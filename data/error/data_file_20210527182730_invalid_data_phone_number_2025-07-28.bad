The biryani's were cooked well, medium spice and a bit salty. The masala in the biryani is in the center and not mixed. So I guess the rice is cooked separately and masala added in the center. Masala for both Kaju and Vegetable is same.\n\nEgg curry was oily and mildly spiced. ginger garlic paste could get cooked better. Raitha tasted very good and I loved it. If there were two biryanis ordered, I expected more onion.\n\nPackaging is ok.\n\nDelivery was well within the specified time."")]",[],Delivery,Brookefield,917349488,,False,False
